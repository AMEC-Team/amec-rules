# Common Rules
## Round Rules
- In principle, participation in all rounds is mandatory. Not complying with this will lead to elimination.
- Basically, abstention is possible in all rounds. Under no further related notice or rules for each round, however, abstention in any round will be treated the same as non-participation.
## Notice to participants
- You may not leak any levels for AMEC Mini 2 (in any form such as video, level files, etc.) without permission from moderators.

# Round 0
- This is like a practice round, where participants can understand how the competition works and become familiar with each other.
- This is an additional round, so participation is not mandatory, and there is no one to be eliminated.

# Round 1
**"Charts must have no pseudos. VFX must have one main color only (a.k.a. one-tone effect)."**

- There are 12 songs for Charters, divided into two groups with 6 songs each. There are 18 songs for VFXers, divided into three groups with 6 songs each. All of them will be released group by group within 30 minutes.
- Participants can choose one of the given songs. If the number of participants who selected the song is too large, there will be
  competition (or consensus) between them. You may also give up choosing and wait until you are assigned a random song.
- Within the given period, Charters must make a chart without pseudos, and VFXers must create a full VFX with only one color theme.
- Each set for the Charters has two "Battle" songs. The two who select these songs compete. Both pass if the sum of their scores is greater than 170, while one with the lower score will fail otherwise.
- VFXers can ask admins to check if their works fit the requirement (one-tone theme) at most twice. Receiving no response from the admins within 24 hours, they can request an individual extension of the deadline by 24 hours.
